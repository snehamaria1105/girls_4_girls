# girls4girls 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: Womingo [Individual]

### Team Members
- Member 1: Sneha Maria - LBSITW

### Hosted Project Link
https://girls4girls.vercel.app/

### Project Description
A community-driven website for girls to share their concerns, queries, and connect, and support each other, with additional features to track menstrual cycles, moods, and personal well-being.

### The Problem statement
Many young girls experience physical, emotional, and psychological changes but feel uncomfortable or unsafe discussing topics such as menstruation, body changes, mental health, and relationships with people around them. Fear of judgment, lack of anonymity, and limited access to reliable peer support prevent them from seeking guidance, leading to confusion, insecurity, and emotional distress. There is a need for a safe, anonymous, and supportive digital platform where girls can express themselves freely, track their emotional and physical well-being, and receive support from a positive community.

### The Solution
Girls 4 Girls is an anonymous, girl-focused community platform that allows users to share their concerns, ask questions, and receive emotional support and advice from peers in a safe and non-judgmental environment. The platform includes features such as anonymous posting and commenting, a daily mood tracker with activity suggestions, and a menstruation tracker to help users understand their emotional patterns and physical cycles.
